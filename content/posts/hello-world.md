excerpt: 'Why I created my blog.'
---

I've been thinking about having a blog for a long time. From time to time I see/discover something that I want to share and social networks are not the most appropriate place all the time.
After reading this article [Every developer should have a blog. Hereâ€™s why, and how to stick with it.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/) I decided to create mine.

"A blog is useful for many reasons. It can become a source of leads, it can be the place where, in the future, you might sell your products if you want to become an indie developer, or it can simply be the place where you have your audience and express your ideas."

You can expect here content mainly about tech and software engineering.
