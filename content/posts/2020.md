I usually use the last couple of days of the year to reflect on the things that have happened and this year was no exception. A couple of numbers of my year:

- Visited two countries and 11 cities
- Completed more than 3000 tasks in Todoist
- Listened more than 400 hours of podcasts
- My heart rate varied from 38 to 180 BPM
- On average, this year setp count was 4421. Lower than last year's because WFH

So I think, all-in-all pretty good. Despite the pandemic has been a pivotal year for me and my career. I hope the next year is just as exciting!
