I usually use the last couple of days of the year to reflect on the things that have happened. A couple of numbers:

- Completed >3000 tasks in Todoist
- Listened >400 hours of podcasts

So I think, all-in-all pretty good. Despite the pandemic has been a pivotal year for me and my career. I hope the next year is just as exciting!
