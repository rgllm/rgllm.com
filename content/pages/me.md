Hello 👋. I’m Rogério, a multidisciplinary developer based in Braga, Portugal 🇵🇹. I graduated from University of Minho and I've been working with Frontend since then. I love solving problems, software engineering, sports, traveling, reading, and I'm passionate about everything tech-related. Currently, focused on expanding my know-how in product development.

- [Awesome Portugal Data](https://github.com/rgllm/awesome-portugal-data/) – a repository of portuguese open data
- [Publish to Netlify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-netlify/) – a WordPress plugin to deploy static sites on Netlify
